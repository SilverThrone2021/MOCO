# MOCO
MOCO, or Motion On COmputer for short, is a fitness based fun game aiming to promote physical activity by implementing interactive gameplay through a smart user interface (UI). This project is specifically designed to exploit the weaknesses of existing solutions, like Xbox Kinect, by eliminating the need to purchase a specific device to utilise a camera based exercise system. 

# How It Works
Users can pick a colour of their choice and within a designated amount of time using body movements colour a shape that is displayed to them. MOCO shows different random shapes on the screen and the user needs to move physically in front of their camera enabled laptop or mobile device to shade the shapes using a colour of their choice. Users will score points proportional to the % of shading they managed to fill within a specified amount of seconds. The script only detects objects with the colour navy-blue, so keep that in mind when playing the game!

# Requirements
To use MOCO, download the 'MOCO.py' script and run it in a python IDE. Make sure to install packages (OpenCV, Keyboard, Tkinter, TkVideo, Moviepy, and Mediapipe) before executing the code. Tested and built on Python 3.7.X.

Only works for devices with a camera.
